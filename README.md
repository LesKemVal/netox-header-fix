# Netox-Header-Fix PWA - Frontend for Real-World Asset & Digital Tokenization Platform

## Project Overview
This project is the frontend user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed to enable tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) and digital assets. The UI is based on the Netox template and has been customized to serve as a platform for asset rankings, token creation, wallet management, and membership/coin systems.

## Key Features
- Responsive, mobile-friendly PWA design
- Token rankings front page (`index.html` from `rankings.html`)
- Navigation includes Explore, Activity, Monetize (NFT creation), Wallet Connect, Profile, and Support pages
- Integration points prepared for coin system and membership levels (e.g., Gold Member badges)
- User profile and wallet management
- Notifications and search functionality
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)

## Project Status
- UI/UX design mostly finalized with cleaned-up Netox header/navbar and essential pages retained
- Backend compliance, dashboards, and transaction logic will be integrated via KoreConX platform at a later stage
- The project is currently static HTML/CSS/JS and ready for PWA conversion and further frontend development

## Developer Guidelines
- Implement PWA features: offline support, service workers, app manifest
- Integrate frontend with KoreConX APIs for compliance, user KYC, asset tokenization, and dashboard display
- Enhance frontend to dynamically display token data, user balances, and membership info based on backend responses
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across all devices
- Use modern frameworks/libraries if preferred (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) or maintain vanilla JS as needed
- Coordinate with backend team for API contracts and testing

## Folder Structure
- `/assets/` - images, icons, styles
- `/index.html` - front page (rankings)
- `/explore.html` - asset discovery
- `/activity.html` & `/activity-2.html` - recent platform activity
- `/create.html` & `/upload-type.html` - token creation flows
- `/wallet-connect.html` & `/wallet.html` - wallet integrations
- `/profile.html`, `/settings.html`, `/logout.html` - user account management
- `/about.html`, `/contact.html` - support pages

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LesKemVal/netox-header-fix.git
   cd netox-header-fix
   ```
2. Run a local HTTP server to test:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
3. Access via `http://localhost:8080` and verify UI functionality
4. Proceed to implement PWA features and API integration

## Notes
- KoreConX integration details and API documentation will be provided separately.
- This project prioritizes frontend readiness for a real-world asset tokenization platform with secure, compliant backend connections.
